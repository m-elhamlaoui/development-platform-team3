## 2. Brief Overview
The Fitness Tracker application is a comprehensive solution designed to help users manage their fitness routines and track their progress over time. The application is built using a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. 

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionalities using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Workout Management**: Allows users to create, update, view, and delete workout routines. Users can specify details such as workout type, sets, reps, duration, and weight used.
- **Progress Tracking**: Enables users to log their progress, including sets completed, reps completed, duration, and weight used for each workout session.
- **User Roles**: Different user roles such as admin and regular users to manage access and permissions.

### Technical Overview:
- **Microservices Architecture**: The backend is divided into two main services:
  - **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
  - **Fitness Service**: Handles workout and progress management.
- **Frontend**: A modern single-page application (SPA) built with React, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL is used as the database for both services to store user data, workouts, and progress logs.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- **Containerization**: The application services are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes is used to deploy, manage, and scale the application containers.

### Detailed Workflow:
1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - Users can register by providing their username and password.
   - Upon registration, the password is hashed and stored securely in the database.
   - Users can log in by providing valid credentials, which are authenticated using JWT. A token is generated and returned to the user for subsequent requests.

2. **Workout Management**:
   - After logging in, users can create workout routines specifying details such as workout name, type, sets, reps, duration, and weight.
   - Users can view their created workouts, update details, or delete workouts as needed.
   - The fitness service handles all CRUD operations related to workouts.

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Users can log their workout progress by recording the sets completed, reps completed, duration, and weight used for each session.
   - Progress logs can be viewed to track improvements over time, providing insights into the userâ€™s fitness journey.

4. **Admin Management**:
   - Admin users have additional capabilities to manage other user accounts, ensuring proper application usage and security.

###  **Implementation and deployement description**

- **Authentication Service**:
  - **Description**: Manages user registration and authentication.
  - **Technologies Used**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT.
  
- **Fitness Service**:
  - **Description**: Manages workout routines and tracks fitness progress.
  - **Technologies Used**: Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate.
  
- **Frontend Application**:
  - **Description**: User interface for interacting with the backend services.
  - **Technologies Used**: React, Axios, PrimeReact.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **Description**: Automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application.
  - **Technologies Used**: GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes.
  
  **Pipeline Details**:
  
  1. **Checkout Code**:
     - **Step**: Uses `actions/checkout@v2` to clone the repository.
     - **Purpose**: Fetches the latest code from the main branch.

  2. **Set up JDK 17**:
     - **Step**: Uses `actions/setup-java@v2` to install Java 17.
     - **Purpose**: Ensures the environment has the correct version of Java to build the Spring Boot applications.

  3. **Build and Test Auth Service**:
     - **Step**: Navigates to the `auth-service` directory, runs `mvn clean install`, and `mvn test`.
     - **Purpose**: Compiles the `auth-service` and runs all unit tests to ensure the code is functioning correctly.

  4. **Build and Test Fitness Service**:
     - **Step**: Navigates to the `fitness-service` directory, runs `mvn clean install`, and `mvn test`.
     - **Purpose**: Compiles the `fitness-service` and runs all unit tests to ensure the code is functioning correctly.
